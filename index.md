# Noise Sensing Auto Recorder
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was writing the code for the Arduino and creating an app to control everything. I got an Arduino nano and first set up initial values for the sensors and threshold. Then I setup bluetooth and the sensors to calulate average the sound level. As for the app, I used the MIT App Inventor to create one. The app works by connecting to the arduino via bluetooth. The microphone will detect noise level and if it crosses the set threshold, it will start recording. Once the sound level goes below the threshold, it stops recording and then is saved. You can also use it as a regular sound recorder, choosing when you want to record. One challenge I faced was that I at first didn't know how to use the bluetooth very well and also I had an error (confusion between integer type for the threshold). All I had to do was change the type and rename the label.
